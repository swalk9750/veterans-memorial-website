This project is a volunteer effort undertaken to better enable Manchester residents and their families to honor the veterans from their community. It is a website intended to serve as a map of the physical monument located at Margaret Stoecker Park, 222 Henry Ave, Manchester, MO 63011.

The repository primarily contains code necessary for the website to run, although some documents not currently in active use remain in the old-files folder to ensure their code can be reused if necessary.

Finally, there is a folder entitled Demo Screenshots which contains four images to demonstrate the functionality of the website.
